    InitBeacon {
        /// beacon info
        init_beacon_info: IncognitoProxy,
    }

## Shield instruction

    ///   Request new shield to move token from Solana -> Incognito.
    ///
    ///   0. `[writable]` Token account to make shield request

    ///   2. `[]` Incognito proxy which stores beacon list and bump seed to retrieve vault token account
    ///   3. `[signer]` Shield maker address
    ///   4. `[]` Spl Token program id
    Shield {
        /// amount to shield
        amount: u64,
        /// destination in privacy layer
        inc_address: [u8; 148],
    }

## Unshield instruction

    ///   1. `[]` Unshield maker address
    ///   2. `[]` $vault_authority derived from `create_program_address(&[incognito proxy account])`
    ///   3. `[writable]` Vault account to store transaction burn id
    ///   4. `[]` Incognito proxy which stores beacon list and bump seed to retrieve vault token account
    ///   5. `[]` Spl Token program id
    ///   6. `[writable]` Associated token account of unshield maker
    UnShield {
        /// unshield info
        unshield_info: UnshieldRequest,
    }
